# Welcome to the Legup Contributing Guide

Thank you for investing your time and contributing to Legup! In this guide, you will get an overview of the general
principles you should follow when contributing to Legup.

## New Contributor Guide

To get an overview of the project, please reference
the [README](https://github.com/Bram-Hub/Legup/blob/master/README.md).

### Getting Started

Before you begin coding, please read
our [programming principles](https://github.com/Bram-Hub/Legup/wiki/Programming-Principles). This will cover our
standards for commenting, documenting and reporting issues, and creating and merging branches.

***If there is any one point that should be emphasized from the programming principles, it's that for the most part, all
developers should branch off of and merge into `dev`***. `dev` will be the only branch that merges into `master` and
will be done under the approval of Dr. van Heuveln.

Please refer to the [developer setup guide](https://github.com/Bram-Hub/Legup/wiki/Programming-Setup-Guide) to get set
up with the Legup repository. Please note that the developer setup guide is a *guide*. We recommend you use IntelliJ and
GitHub Desktop, but feel free to use other IDEs and/or the command line if you feel more comfortable with that.
