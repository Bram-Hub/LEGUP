# Welcome to the Legup Contributing Guide
Thank you for investing your time and contributing to Legup! In this guide, you will get an overview of the general principles you should follow when contributing to Legup.

## New Contributor Guide
To get an overview of the project, please reference the [README](https://github.com/Bram-Hub/Legup/blob/master/README.md).

### Getting Started
Before you begin coding, please read our [programming principles](https://github.com/Bram-Hub/Legup/wiki/Programming-Principles). This will cover our standards for commenting, documenting and reporting issues, and creating and merging branches.

***If there is any one point that should be emphasized from the programming principles, it's that for the most part, all developers should branch off of and merge into `dev`***. `dev` will be the only branch that merges into `master` and will be done under the approval of Dr. van Heuveln.

Please refer to the [developer setup guide](https://github.com/Bram-Hub/Legup/wiki/Programming-Setup-Guide) to get set up with the Legup repository. Please note that the developer setup guide is a *guide*. We recommend you use IntelliJ and GitHub Desktop, but feel free to use other IDEs and/or the command line if you feel more comfortable with that.

This guide is loosely adapted from the [GitHub docs contributing guide](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
