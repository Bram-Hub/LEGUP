HELPER FUNCTIONS: (check morgue for unused helpers, ctrl+f "helper function")
    -getRowCol
        Location: skyscrapersBoard
        Use: returns elements in a row or col
        Notes: more than one element type? (Added an Any type to help with this!)
    -printBoard
        Location: skyscrapersBoard
        Use: Prints the data array to console
        Notes: Pretty useful for debugging where boards aren't printed

CODE MORGUE:
    - Exporter has no known use, to has not been updated
    - SkyscapersLine, SkyscrapersLineView
        Locations: above classes, Board, Importer, CellFactory, View
        Uses: drawing lines between cells on the board
        Note: No purpose for lines in this puzzle yet,
              probably should remove all instances of their use for cleanliness' sake
    - isForced, getDefaultBoard
        Locations:
        Uses?: Unknown
        Notes: Seems like a sanity check, but I cannot find a situation where it runs
    -getDiagonals
        Location: skyscrapersBoard
        Use: helper function - gets cells immediately diagonal to a cell
        Note: If you implement this, move it from morgue to helper functions section!
    -getAdjacent
        Location: skyscrapersBoard
        Use: helper function - gets cells immediately adjacent to a cell
        Note: If you implement this, move it from morgue to helper functions section!
    -Skyscrapers Exporter
