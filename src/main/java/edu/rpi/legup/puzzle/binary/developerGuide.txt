Developer Setup Guide (For Linux Users)

This setup guide is aimed towards developers planning on using a 
device using linux to contribute to this project.

Software used:
    package manager: apt
    text editor: neovim
    Git
    Gradle
    Java

This step-by-step guide assumes the use of Ubuntu, one of the most 
commonly used Linux Distros (the steps are the same for any Ubuntu Flavors)
and for any ubuntu/debian based systems, like Linux mint, elementary os, pop os,
and others. For other linux distros, the steps will be extremely similar, but the 
commands will change slightly based on the development environment and package manager.
For example, updating in ubuntu will be "$ sudo apt update" because it uses the apt 
package manager, but in Arch based distros, updating could be "sudo pacman -Syy" 
because it uses the pacman package manager, so for uncommon distros, you just have
to familiarize yourself with their commands (or do some quick google searches).

Before getting started with any installation, for good practice always update your packages,
so first enter the following command in the terminal:

        sudo apt update


1. Choosing where to code

The fist step is choosing where you will be coding, that could be a full fledge IDE or just 
a simple text editor, anything from nano to JetBrains Intellij, a fantastic in between is the
neovim text editor, which is a terminal based text editor that supports plugins using the Lua
programming language

to install neovim first make sure your system has snapd:
    
    sudo apt install snapd

then install neovim

    sudo snap install nvim --classic




Choose where to code â€“ neovim
