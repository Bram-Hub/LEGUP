Developer Setup Guide (For Linux Users)

This setup guide is aimed towards developers planning on using a 
device using linux to contribute to this project.

Software used:
    - package manager: apt & sdk
    - text editor: neovim
    - Git
    - Gradle
    - Java (v21)  (yes the version matters)

This step-by-step guide assumes the use of Ubuntu, one of the most 
commonly used Linux Distros (the steps are the same for any Ubuntu Flavors)
and for any ubuntu/debian based systems, like Linux mint, elementary os, pop os,
and others. For other linux distros, the steps will be extremely similar, but the 
commands will change slightly based on the development environment and package manager.
For example, updating in ubuntu will be "$ sudo apt update" because it uses the apt 
package manager, but in Arch based distros, updating could be "sudo pacman -Syy" 
because it uses the pacman package manager, so for other distros, you just have
to familiarize yourself with their commands (or do some quick google searches).

Before getting started with any installation, for good practice always update your packages,
so first enter the following command in the terminal:

        sudo apt update


1. Choosing where to code

The fist step is choosing where you will be coding, that could be a full fledge IDE or just 
a simple text editor, anything from nano to JetBrains Intellij, a fantastic in between is the
neovim text editor, which is a terminal based text editor that supports plugins using the Lua
programming language


to install neovim first make sure your system has snapd:
    
    sudo apt install snapd


then install neovim

    sudo snap install nvim --classic


install git (you can use github desktop if you wish)
    
    sudo apt install git


install java

 if you already installed java, like throught the "install default-jre" command, check your java version with

    java -version


in order for legup to work, you need java 21 on your system, so get it through

    sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk -y

    wget https://download.oracle.com/java/21/latest/jdk-21_linux-x64_bin.deb

    sudo apt install ./jdk-21_linux-x64_bin.deb

now running "java -version" should show java 21 installed


install gradle 

    sudo apt install curl

    sudo apt install curl

    source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"

    sdk install gradle


Forking the repository
    
    SAME PROCCESS AS NORMAL SETUP GUIDE [COPY]

Downloading the project
    
    git clone "https://github.com/*YOUR USERNAME*/*YOUR FORK OF LEGUP*"

Opening the project with ide or text editor

    go to where the project is, go to the directory where the files are then do

    nvim filename

    to exit and save in neovim you must do Esc, :, w, q, Enter


running legup

    to run legup, you have to go to the directory where the "build.gradle file is"
    assuming you cloned the repository into your Documents/GitHub directory, you
    should go to (you can do cd and the following directory) ~/Documents/GitHub/*YOUR FORKED REPO*
    and enter 
            
            ./gradlew build

    and to run
        
            ./gradlew run
